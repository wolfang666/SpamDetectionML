# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Logistic Regression and Gmail API

A modular **Spam Email Detection System** built using:

- A pre-trained **Logistic Regression** model (trained on 6 Kaggle datasets)
- A **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- The official **Gmail API** to fetch real-time emails from Gmail

---

## 📝 Project Description

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline for Spam Email Detection:

- A Logistic Regression model was trained offline using **6 Kaggle datasets** from the [Phishing Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset), combining the following corpora:
  - `SpamAssasin.csv`
  - `CEAS_08.csv`
  - `Enron.csv`
  - `Ling.csv`
  - `Nazario.csv`
  - `Nigerian_Fraud.csv`
- The model and TF-IDF vectorizer were saved as `.pkl` files for reusable inference.
- Emails are fetched from the user's Gmail account via the **Gmail API**.
- The **email subject and body are combined**, processed, and classified as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

---
Download the datasets from kaggle. 
Then place them in the following folder:

```
model_training/
    SpamAssasin.csv
    CEAS_08.csv
    Enron.csv
    Ling.csv
    Nazario.csv
    Nigerian_Fraud.csv

```
After placing the CSV files, run the training script:

```bash
python model_training/logisticregression.py
```

This will generate:

-Spam_Detection_Model.pkl

-features.pkl

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpamDetectionML.git
cd SpamDetectionML
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Setup Gmail API Credentials

- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Enable the **Gmail API** and create **OAuth2 credentials**
- Download `credentials.json` and place it in your project folder.
- ⚠️ `credentials.json` is included in `.gitignore` → do NOT push this file to GitHub!
- The first time you run the script, it will generate `token.json` (also ignored) after completing the OAuth flow.

## 📊 Results

- **Accuracy on testing data**: **98.61%**

- **Confusion Matrix**:

|                | Predicted Not Spam | Predicted Spam |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Actual Not Spam| 11737              | 216            |
| Actual Spam    | 126                | 12667          |

- **Precision** ≈ **98.32%**  
- **Recall** ≈ **99.01%**  
- **F1-score** ≈ **98.66%**

- The model demonstrates strong generalization and balance between **catching spam** and **avoiding false positives**.
